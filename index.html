  <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
  <p>Completing the Computer Science program and the CS 499 capstone has allowed me
to integrate technical knowledge, professional communication skills, and
problem-solving strategies into a cohesive portfolio that reflects my growth
as a computer science professional. Through coursework and project-based
learning, I have strengthened my ability to design, develop, and evaluate
software solutions while considering real-world constraints such as
performance, security, and maintainability.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the program, I collaborated with peers and stakeholders through
code reviews, design discussions, and written documentation. These experiences
reinforced the importance of clear communication when explaining technical
concepts to diverse audiences. I learned to adapt my explanations depending on
whether I was addressing instructors, teammates, or non-technical stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
My coursework emphasized core computer science concepts such as data structures
and algorithms, software engineering practices, and database design. I applied
these skills in multiple projects, including algorithm-focused enhancements,
object-oriented software design improvements, and normalized relational database
solutions with secure data access. Together, these experiences prepared me to
design scalable, efficient, and secure computing solutions.
</p>

<p>
Security awareness has been an essential part of my development. I learned to
identify potential vulnerabilities, validate inputs, use defensive programming
techniques, and apply secure database access methods. This mindset ensures that
security is considered throughout the development lifecycle rather than as an
afterthought.
</p>

<p>
The artifacts presented in this portfolio demonstrate my ability to apply
computer science principles across software design and engineering, algorithms
and data structures, and databases. Together, they represent my readiness to
enter the computer science profession and contribute value through well-founded,
secure, and thoughtfully designed solutions.
