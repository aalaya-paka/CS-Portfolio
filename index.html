  <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

<p>
Completing the Computer Science program and the CS 499 capstone has allowed me to
integrate technical knowledge, professional communication skills, and structured
problem-solving strategies into a cohesive portfolio that reflects my growth as a
computer science professional. Throughout the program, I developed the ability
to design, implement, and evaluate computing solutions while considering real-world
constraints such as performance, maintainability, and security.
</p>

<p>
Collaboration and communication were essential components of my coursework.
Through activities such as code reviews, design discussions, and written technical
documentation, I gained experience explaining complex technical concepts to
diverse audiences. These experiences strengthened my ability to support informed
decision-making by stakeholders with both technical and non-technical backgrounds.
</p>

<p>
My academic work emphasized core computer science competencies including data
structures and algorithms, software design and engineering, and database systems.
I applied these principles through hands-on projects that required algorithmic
analysis, object-oriented design, and the development of structured and normalized
databases. These projects reinforced the importance of selecting appropriate tools
and techniques to build efficient, scalable solutions.
</p>

<p>
Security awareness has been an integral part of my development as a computer
science professional. I learned to identify potential vulnerabilities, apply
defensive programming practices, validate inputs, and use secure database access
methods. This security mindset ensures that reliability and data protection are
considered throughout the software development lifecycle.
</p>

<p>
The artifacts presented in this portfolio demonstrate my ability to apply computer
science principles across software design and engineering, algorithms and data
structures, and databases. Together, these artifacts reflect my readiness to enter
the computer science profession and contribute value through well-designed, secure,
and thoughtfully engineered solutions.
