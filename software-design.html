<h1>Software Design & Engineering Enhancement</h1>

<p>
This artifact demonstrates my ability to apply software design and engineering
principles to enhance an existing codebase. The enhancement focused on improving
code organization, readability, and stability while preserving the original
functionality of the application.
</p>

<p>
Through this enhancement, I applied object-oriented design principles, improved
separation of responsibilities, and introduced defensive programming techniques.
These changes support maintainability and reduce the likelihood of runtime errors,
which are critical considerations in production-quality software.
</p>

<p>
This enhancement illustrates my progress toward professional software engineering
practices and demonstrates my ability to evaluate design trade-offs, implement
improvements iteratively, and align technical decisions with project requirements
and stakeholder needs.
