<h1>Software Design & Engineering Enhancement</h1>

<p>
This artifact demonstrates my ability to apply software design and engineering principles to enhance an existing codebase.
The enhancement focused on improving code organization, readability, and stability while preserving original functionality.
</p>

<p>
Through this enhancement, I applied professional development practices such as clearer separation of responsibilities,
defensive programming, and improved maintainability. These changes support long-term scalability and reduce the likelihood
of runtime errors in real-world software systems.
</p>

<p>
This enhancement aligns with CS 499 outcomes related to implementing professional computing solutions and delivering value
through well-founded design practices.
