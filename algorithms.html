<h1>Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement</h1>

<p>
This artifact demonstrates my understanding of algorithms and data structures through targeted improvements to an existing implementation.
The enhancement focused on improving efficiency and clarifying algorithmic intent while preserving original behavior.
</p>

<p>
I analyzed frequently executed logic and applied improvements such as reducing redundant computations and adding early-exit conditions.
These changes strengthen performance in real-time execution and improve readability for future maintenance.
</p>

<p>
This enhancement aligns with CS 499 outcomes related to designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles and
managing trade-offs in implementation decisions.
