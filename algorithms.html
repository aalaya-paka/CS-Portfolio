<h1>Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement</h1>

<p>
This artifact focuses on demonstrating my understanding of algorithms and data
structures through targeted improvements to an existing implementation. The
enhancement emphasized algorithmic efficiency, clarity of logic, and thoughtful
use of data structures.
</p>

<p>
I analyzed the behavior of frequently executed logic and applied small but
meaningful improvements such as reducing redundant computations and clarifying
algorithmic intent. These changes preserved the original behavior while improving
performance and maintainability.
</p>

<p>
This enhancement reflects my ability to evaluate algorithmic trade-offs and apply
computer science principles to optimize real-world code. It demonstrates progress
toward designing efficient and reliable solutions using well-founded algorithmic
techniques.
