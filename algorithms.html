<h1>Software Design & Engineering Enhancement</h1>

<p>
This artifact demonstrates my ability to apply software design and engineering
principles to improve an existing codebase. The enhancement focused on improving
code structure, maintainability, and defensive programming while preserving
original functionality.

<p>
Through this enhancement, I demonstrated progress toward professional software
engineering practices, including clearer separation of responsibilities,
improved readability, and consideration of security and stability concerns.
