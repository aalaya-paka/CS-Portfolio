<h1>Informal Code Review</h1>

<p>
This informal code review was conducted as part of the CS 499 capstone project.
The purpose of the review was to evaluate an existing software artifact,
explain its current functionality, identify areas for improvement, and outline
planned enhancements aligned with course outcomes.
</p>

<p>
During the review, I examined code structure, logic flow, readability, maintainability,
and potential security considerations. I discussed how the software currently operates
and explained my rationale for the planned enhancements. This process demonstrates
professional communication skills and the ability to convey technical concepts clearly
to peers or stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
The code review also reflects collaborative development practices commonly used in
professional environments, such as reflective analysis, justification of design decisions,
and consideration of software quality attributes.
