<h1>Code Review (Milestone One)</h1>

<p>
This informal code review was completed as part of CS 499 to evaluate an existing
software artifact and plan targeted enhancements. The review explains the current
functionality of the code, identifies opportunities for improvement, and outlines
planned modifications aligned with CS 499 course outcomes.
</p>

<p>
During the review, I examined structure, readability, logic flow, maintainability,
and potential security considerations. I explained how the software currently operates
and described why the planned enhancements were selected.
