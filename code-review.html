<h1>Informal Code Review</h1>

<p>
This code review was completed as part of CS 499 to evaluate an existing artifact and plan targeted enhancements.
The review explains the current functionality of the code, identifies opportunities for improvement, and
describes planned modifications aligned with CS 499 course outcomes.
</p>

<p>
During the review, I examined structure, readability, logic flow, maintainability, and potential security concerns.
The process demonstrates professional communication by clearly explaining technical findings to an audience such as
peers or a manager.
