<h1>Informal Code Review</h1>

<p>
This code review was conducted as part of CS 499 to evaluate an existing software
artifact and plan targeted enhancements. The review focused on explaining the
current functionality of the code, identifying areas for improvement, and outlining
planned modifications aligned with course outcomes.
</p>

<p>
During the review, I examined code structure, logic flow, readability, and potential
design concerns. I also considered maintainability and security implications, such
as defensive programming and validation. The review process required communicating
technical details clearly and effectively to an audience that may include peers or
managers.
</p>

<p>
This code review demonstrates my ability to analyze existing software, communicate
technical findings, and justify enhancement decisions. It also highlights my
experience participating in collaborative development practices commonly used in
professional software environments.
