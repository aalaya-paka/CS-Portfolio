<h1>Database Design & Implementation Enhancement</h1>

<p>
This artifact demonstrates my ability to design and implement a relational database using sound database principles.
The enhancement compares an initial denormalized schema with an improved design incorporating normalization, constraints,
and secure data access practices.
</p>

<p>
The enhanced database includes relational modeling elements such as primary and foreign keys, integrity constraints,
and indexes to support performance. A companion application script demonstrates secure interaction using parameterized
queries and input validation.
</p>

<p>
This enhancement aligns with CS 499 outcomes related to implementing computing solutions that deliver value and applying
a security mindset to protect data integrity and privacy.
