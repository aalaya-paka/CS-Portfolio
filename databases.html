<h1>Database Design & Implementation Enhancement</h1>

<p>
This artifact demonstrates my ability to design and implement a relational database
using sound database principles. The enhancement compares an initial, denormalized
schema with an improved design that incorporates normalization, constraints, and
secure data access practices.
</p>

<p>
The enhanced database applies relational modeling techniques, including primary and
foreign keys, integrity constraints, and indexing to support data consistency and
performance. A companion application script demonstrates secure interaction with
the database using parameterized queries and input validation.
</p>

<p>
This enhancement highlights my understanding of how database design decisions impact
data integrity, scalability, and security. It also demonstrates a security-focused
approach to data management that aligns with professional computing standards.
